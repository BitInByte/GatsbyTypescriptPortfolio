This was the year that I decided to went back to studies and I took a network course to learn new stuff and concepts. I went to protocols, configurations, each type of network equipment, cisco configurations, all about network. It was 2 years of study where I made at the same time that I was working to support myself. I made a lot of network experiments in home that made me understand another world aside the programming and hardware.
