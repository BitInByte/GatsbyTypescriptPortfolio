In 2019 I made an internship on a network company where I stayed for 4 months and then I got the oportunity to start my studies again. I had the oportunity to start my Software Engineering BSc (Hons) degree on the UK where I've been enroled and so motivated to finish it. We are working with **Python** to make some data analysis and **Java** to develop software where we're learning deeper, even how to start from datagrams and uml tables to the app itself.

In one of my github pages [here](https://github.com/JayFoxFoxy?tab=repositories) you can find some old projects, unfinished projects and my university projects, even some cisco configurations that I made with packet tracer.
