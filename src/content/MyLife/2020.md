In 2020 I decided to make an effort to study consistently and put aside games and friends. I wanted to prepare myself to be independent programmer and to improve myself as a developer and as a person.

I decided to explore all of the old technologies such that **JS ES5** and older versions and all of the **CSS** methods before **grid** and **flexbox** and after learning all the stuff was made years ago, I decided to learn the new **Vanilla Javascript** versions and **CSS3** with **flexbox** and **grid**, after that I learned **React** and more recently **Typescript**. For that I took a couple of courses from Udemy, some of them, [Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/), [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/),[The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/),[React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/),[Understanding TypeScript - 2020 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/), plus, I went through a lot of youtube tutorials and videos, books and documentations to implement some projects as practice. I will continue my journey as developer and find myself time in my routine eveyday to study more and more and learn new concepts day after day.
