After 3 years of insistence, my father gave me my first computer by a gift after carry over from school year!  
The computer was a pentium 4 with 256Mb and WinXp installed. That was the beginning of my admiration for technology and computers. I was so curious that one day I just disassembled the whole computer and reassembled again just to understand how all pieces works together. This year was the beginning of my tech journey.
