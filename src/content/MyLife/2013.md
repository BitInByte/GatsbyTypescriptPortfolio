In 2013 I made my internship to apply some of the concepts that we learned. We was supposed to work inside of the interniship and outside of it. To finish the course we was supposed to apply the core concepts of the course and for my final project I decided to create an application to let people get ride from another people. The project had 2 sections, the driver and the person who needed a ride. We could made a login and based on the database we could start a session via php to access restricted area, then the project add google maps integration to let the people select the route and the driver could accept the route specified for one day and one hour. Everything was made with **HTML**, **CSS**, **PHP** and **SQL**. After this year I decided to make a small break from school and learn new stuff such that modelling with CAD and still learn new stuff about programming and web developing.
