With the IT Technician course, we were supposed to do an internship on a company to evaluate how we was able to put into practice everything that we learned over the course. Made a lot of friends there and learned a lot. We just made stuff like troubleshooting, repairing computers, fixing softwareâ€™s and installing software and eliminating virus on the customers machines. After around 3 months of internship I just completed my course getting my certificate.

On the summer I was evaluating the next step and I just felt into some topics over the internet about programming! I've found a video on the youtube about programming in **Pascal** and that was a tutorial to **create a calculator**. I just decided to do that tutorial and that made me feel so alive again. I was so boring because fixing machines was good but I always felt that I wanted to learn something bigger, I wanted to learn the magic behind the mouse click over a button, I wanted to learn why a window opens when we click a button and how the computer knows that 2 + 1 is 3?

After that tutorial I decided to start another course on the same school, this one to be a software developer. That course was all about **PHP**, **HTML**, **CSS** and **SQL**.
